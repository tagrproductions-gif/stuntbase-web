-- This handles automatic cleanup of files in Supabase Storage
-- =====================================================

-- Create function to clean up profile photos from storage

-- =====================================================
-- IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT STORAGE CLEANUP:
-- =====================================================
-- ðŸš¨ LIMITATION: PostgreSQL triggers cannot directly call Supabase Storage API
-- 
-- âœ… WHAT THIS DOES:
-- - Logs storage paths that should be deleted via RAISE NOTICE
-- - Provides the foundation for proper cleanup
-- 
-- ðŸ”§ TO COMPLETE STORAGE CLEANUP, YOU NEED ONE OF:
-- 1. Supabase Edge Function called by trigger
-- 2. Application-level cleanup (current approach in your code)
-- 3. Periodic cleanup job that checks for orphaned files
-- 
-- ðŸ’¡ YOUR CURRENT CODE ALREADY HANDLES STORAGE CLEANUP CORRECTLY
-- in deleteProfileAction() and deletePhotoAction() - these triggers
-- provide additional safety net and logging
